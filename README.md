- 👋 Hi, I’m Chris aka CrazyChair69!
- 👀 I’m interested in sports, gaming, cooking, animes and making strange sounds with my mouth.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning algorithms and data structures. Java as well.
-     I've learned the fundamentals of Python and "dipped" into some libraries like math, random and numpy.
-     Overall, I'm a beginner.
- 💞️ I'll appreciate your help!
